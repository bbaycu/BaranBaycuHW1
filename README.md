The project is a delegate assigner using counted votes as input in a hypothetical country that uses 2 alternative measures for different elections that always has 2 candidates running.\n
The first way of measuring is based on district winners. The candidate that wins the district gets all the delegates from said district. If there is a tie in a district, no one gets delegates from that district.
The other way of measuring is based on popular vote percentage. In cases where there is floating numbers in the percentages, the percentages are rounded. For example, if candidate A has 6.51 delegates and candidate B has 2.49 delegates as a result of computation, candidate A gets 7 and candidate B gets 2 delegates.
